# DHI Attestations and Scanner Integration

**Attestations**

In addition to providing a minimal and secure base image, Docker Hardened Images include a comprehensive set of attestations.

You can run the following command to see the full list of attestations for `dhi-node:24-debian13`:
```bash
docker scout attest list $$orgname$$/dhi-node:24-debian13
```
In the output you will see the list of available attestations, such as:
* CycloneDX SBOM (A software bill of materials in CycloneDX format, listing components, libraries, and versions.)
* in-toto vulnerabilities (A list of known vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting the image's components)
* OpenVEX (A document that identifies vulnerabilities that do not apply to the image and explains why)
* Scout health (A signed attestation from Docker Scout that summarizes the overall security and quality posture of the image)
* Scout provenance (Provenance metadata generated by Docker Scout, including the source Git commit, build parameters, and environment details)
* Scout SBOM (An SBOM generated and signed by Docker Scout)
* Scout secret scan (Results of a scan for accidentally included secrets)
* Scout test report (A record of automated tests run against the image)
* Scout vulnerabilities (A vulnerability report generated by Docker Scout)
* SLSA provenance (A standard SLSA provenance statement describing how the image was built)
* SLSA verification summary (A summary attestation indicating the image's compliance with SLSA requirements)
* SPDX SBOM (An SBOM in SPDX format)

**View SBOMs in Docker Hardened Images**

DHI provides SBOMs in the CycloneDX, SPDX, or Scout formats. To view a specific SBOM file, such as the SPDX SBOM that is widely adopted in open-source ecosystems, you can use the `docker scout attest get` command:
```bash
docker scout attest get $$orgname$$/dhi-node:24-debian13 \
--predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document
```

**FedRAMP Compliance**

FIPS 140 compliance is required or strongly recommended in many regulated environments where sensitive data must be protected, such as government, healthcare, finance, and defense.

DHIs include variants that use cryptographic modules validated under FIPS 140. 

You can retrieve and inspect the FIPS attestation for the `$$orgname$$/dhi-node:24-debian13-fips` using the Docker Scout CLI:
```bash
docker scout attest get --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/fips/v0.1 --predicate $$orgname$$/dhi-node:24-debian13-fips
```
In the output you'll see the CMVP # and the FIPS Provider name, for example:
```plaintext no-copy-button
"certification": "CMVP #4985",
"certificationUrl": "https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/certificate/4985",
"name": "OpenSSL FIPS Provider",
"package": "pkg:dhi/openssl-provider-fips@3.1.2",
"standard": "FIPS 140-3",
"status": "active",
"sunsetDate": "2030-03-10",
"version": "3.1.2"
```
Docker also provides a signed STIG scan attestation for each STIG-hardened image.

You can retrieve and inspect a STIG scan attestation using the Docker Scout CLI:
```bash
docker scout attest get --predicate-type https://docker.com/dhi/stig/v0.1 --predicate $$orgname$$/dhi-node:24-debian13-fips
```
**Integration with external security tools**

To verify the security posture using an external scanning tool you already use, such as Grype or Trivy, you will need to pass the vulnerability information in a compatible format, which Docker Scout can generate for you.

First, you can view the list of available attestations for the DHI-based image using the `docker scout attest` command:
```bash
docker scout attest list $$orgname$$/demo-node-dhi:v1
```

You'll see two OpenVEX files: one for the DHI base image and another for any custom exceptions (like no-dsa) specific to your image.

Then, to integrate this information with external tools, you can export the VEX data into a vex.json file. Starting with Docker Scout v1.18.3, you can use the `docker scout vex get` command to get the merged VEX document from all VEX attestations:

```bash
docker scout vex get $$orgname$$/demo-node-dhi:v1 --output vex.json
```

This generates a `vex.json` file containing all VEX statements for the specified image. Tools that support VEX can then use this file to suppress known non-exploitable CVEs.
